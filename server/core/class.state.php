/**
 * Secondary state handling
 *
 * This class works exactly the same as standard PHP sessions files. We implement it here
 * so we can have improved granularity and don't have to put everything into the session
 * variables. Basically we have multiple session objects corresponding to multiple webclient
 * objects on the client. This class also locks the session files (in the same way as standard
 * PHP sessions), in order to serialize requests from the same client object.
 *
 * The main reason for creating this is to improve performance; normally PHP will lock the session
 * file for as long as your PHP request is running. However, we want to do multiple PHP requests at
 * once. For this reason, we only use the PHP session system for login information, and use this
 * class for other state information. This means that we can set a message as 'read' at the same time
 * as opening a dialog to view a message. 
 *
 * Currently, there is one 'state' for each 'subsystem'. The 'subsystem' is simply a tag which is appended
 * to the request URL when the client does an XML request. Each 'subsystem' has its own state file.
 *
 * Currently the subsystem is equal to the module ID. This means that if you have two requests from the same
 * module, they will have to wait for eachother. In practice this should hardly ever happen.
